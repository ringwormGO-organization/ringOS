# How to develop for ringOSY
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZQftyCk7_SeZRitx5MjBKzTtvk0pHMtp

# System requiretmens for developing:
  1. Qemu (for virtual machine)
  2. WSL 2
  3. Docker Desktop
  4. Visual Studio Code
  5. Rufus (for real hardware)
  6. Powershell (if you use Windows)
  
If you have problem with running ringOSY, create new issue or check out https://github.com/davidcallanan/os-series


## Setup

Build an image for our build-environment:
 - `docker build buildenv -t myos-buildenv`

## Build

Enter build environment:
 - Linux or MacOS: `docker run --rm -it -v "$(pwd)":/root/env myos-buildenv`
 - Windows (CMD): `docker run --rm -it -v "%cd%":/root/env myos-buildenv`
 - Windows (PowerShell): `docker run --rm -it -v "${pwd}:/root/env" myos-buildenv`
 - Please use the linux command if you are using `WSL`, `msys2` or `git bash`
 - NOTE: If you are having trouble with an unshared drive, ensure your docker daemon has access to the drive you're development environment is in. For Docker Desktop, this is in "Settings > Shared Drives" or "Settings > Resources > File Sharing".

Build for x86 (other architectures may come in the future):
 - `make build-x86_64`
 - If you are using Qemu, please close it before running this command to prevent errors.

To leave the build environment, enter `exit`.

## Emulate

You can emulate your operating system using [Qemu](https://www.qemu.org/): (Don't forget to [add qemu to your path](https://dev.to/whaleshark271/using-qemu-on-windows-10-home-edition-4062#:~:text=2.-,Add%20Qemu%20path%20to%20environment%20variables%20settings,-Copy%20the%20Qemu)!)

 - `qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom dist/x86_64/kernel.iso`
 - Note: Close the emulator when finished, so as to not block writing to `kernel.iso` for future builds.

If the above command fails, try one of the following:
 - Windows: [`qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom dist/x86_64/kernel.iso -L "C:\Program Files\qemu"`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66266448/qemu-could-not-load-pc-bios-bios-256k-bin)
 - Linux: [`qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom dist/x86_64/kernel.iso -L /usr/share/qemu/`](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/134893/cannot-start-kvm-vm-because-missing-bios)
 - Alternatively, install a custom BIOS binary file and link it to Qemu using the `-L` option.

Alternatively, you should be able to load the operating system on a USB drive (MBR partition style) and boot into it when you turn on your computer.
